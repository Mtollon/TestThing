# Installation

**Attention:** The cog names in this repo are all TitleCase. This goes against [Red conventions](https://red-discordbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide_cog_creation.html) but I prefer it.

Here are the [Red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) commands to add this repository (use your bot's prefix in place of `[p]`):
```
[p]load downloader
[p]repo add CBD-Cogs https://gitlab.com/CrunchBangDev/cbd-cogs
```

You may be prompted to respond with "I agree" after that.


# Cogs

You can install individual cogs like this:
```
[p]cog install CBD-Cogs [cog]
```

Just replace `[cog]` with the name of the cog you want to install.

## Bio

Add information to your player bio and lookup information others have shared.

Bio is basically a key/value store for each user where the allowed keys are determined by server admins.

## Bookmark

Allow users to use a reaction in order to bookmark messages for later review.

Add a reaction to bookmark a message and remove the reaction to remove it from your bookmarks.

## Scrub

Applies a set of rules to remove undesireable elements from hyperlinks such as campaign tracking tokens.

Since bots can't edit people's messages, it reposts the cleaned links.
